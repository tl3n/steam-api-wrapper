# @tl3n/steam-api-wrapper

A simple wrapper for Steam Web API with support of TypeScript types.

# Installation

```sh
# Using npm
npm install @tl3n/steam-api-wrapper
```

# Getting Started

Before proceeding further, make sure that you have obtained Steam Web API key. More information can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev).

Let's start with an example. Imagine, that you need to obtain news posts for Team Fortress 2, or your hamster will die tomorrow. Don't panic! It's really easy to do:

```js
import { SteamClient, SteamNewsService } from "@tl3n/steam-api-wrapper";

// Create a new Steam client with your API key.
const steamClient = new SteamClient("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE");

// Create news service with your steamClient.
const newsService = new SteamNewsSerivce(steamClient);

// And now, all we need to do is to call our method.
const news = await newsService.GetNewsForApp({ appid: 440 });
```

And voil√†! Your hamster will live another day.

```json
{
  appnews: {
    appid: 440,
    newsitems: [
      [Object], [Object], [Object],
      [Object], [Object], [Object],
      [Object], [Object], [Object],
      [Object], [Object], [Object],
      [Object], [Object], [Object],
      [Object], [Object], [Object],
      [Object], [Object]
    ],
    count: 3687
  }
}
```
